      <p>For the last ~5 months, I've been wanting to create a blog on my frustrations with programmers: project leads, teammates, mentees, friendsâ€”all of whom collectively have a good assorted mix of experience and skillset. Took me a while to properly internalize and reason about the core cause, one true culprit, but here we go. </p>
<p>The most important skill to get software to run is deciphering error messages. </p>
<p>Not writing clean code, or any of that sort. Reading error messages.</p>
<p>If that's all you can do, you're probably not writing objectively good software. But atleast <em>it compiles and runs.</em> And probably even does it job well, even though looking at a handful of software and websites I use daily, that's regretfully no longer a necessity either.</p>
<p>If you ever glanced at my twitter or worked with me, you'd know that I'm a particularly nitpicky code reviewer who upholds high standards for code cleanliness, decently-not-messy architecture, and performant code (i.e. not doing wasteful allocations or computations; javascript programmers, I hate all of you). A good % of programs that just &quot;compile and run&quot;, under my standards, would go straight into the trash.</p>
<p>Now you'd ask, why on earth would I put &quot;being able to read error message and get things to work&quot; as the bar?</p>
<p>Here's few highlights from these couple of months, all where I just looked at what they showed me for five seconds and have to keep myself from yelling out my gut response:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hey, so, I can't get this to work...&quot;. It's a type mismatch of course it doesn't compile.</li>
<li>&quot;Hey so this thing apparently crashes on runtime...&quot;. Dude it says that the port is in use did you even read.</li>
<li>&quot;So hey, we can't get Firebase to work at all with Rust....&quot;. Dude look at the error, it's an 403 forbidden it's an auth error it has nothing to do with the language choice.</li>
<li>&quot;Hi I think you need to enable CORS on the backend? I got this error...&quot;. Dude, it says right there Mixed Content error, content must be served with HTTPS. Did you even read?</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, they fare no better when reading emails, PR reviews, and such. But oh well, writing down examples for that too will further drain my <em>very</em> rapidly dwindling faith in the future of software engineering, so let's not.</p>
<p>But really,</p>
<p><em>Sighs.</em></p>
<p>What the hell is wrong with our CS education? Or really, our education as a whole?</p>
<p>What can we do to stop churning out devs that can't effing read?</p>
