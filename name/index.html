        <h2 id="what-s-with-the-western-name">What's with the western name?</h2>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah that name made it sound like you grew up at a Christian Suburb here.&quot; - friend</em></p>
<p>I'm Chinese-Indonesian. At the time I was born, weren't allowed to legally have Chinese names, 
so my parents picked a whatever one.</p>
<p>My &quot;real&quot; name is romanized by my family as &quot;Phén Àiqīn&quot; (lastname firstname).
That's how the &quot;Philip&quot; surname came to be by the way; my parents wanted something that starts with &quot;Ph&quot;.
My real name is partly lost to me, though.</p>
<p>My surname Phén is 彭. It would be romanized in proper pinyin as Péng.</p>
<p>The Ài is 爱; love. Yeah, basic.</p>
<p>The Qīn has been lost. My 奶奶, who named me, changed her mind on the character she wanted to use,
and picked a new one that has the same pronunciation. She has since passed away, so what she exactly picked
is lost to time. I was told that it means emperor, or something? I tried reverse engineering it
, but given that my family does not use official pinyin romanization (they never learned it), 
I have no idea if it's even a Qīng or a Qīn. I've been told by 
Chinese friends that Qīng probably makes more sense? Who knows. </p>
<p>You are free to call me my western name, or Àiqīn/Àiqīng, I have no real preference.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chinese-sounding name ban, all chinese language education was banned as well
when all of my family members were growing up, so nobody really learned proper hanyu pinyin. 
Nor generally have any idea what's going on with the language.</p>
<h2 id="wait-hold-up-what">Wait, hold up, what?</h2>
<p>Chinese-Indonesian is an ethnic minority (about ~1% of pop.) in Indonesia.
We have been a target for discrimination, easy political scapegoat, and 
serious violences for centuries, even prior to the creation of a 
united Indonesian state.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto">&quot;New Order&quot;</a>, considered by some
as the worst military dictatorship and authoritarian state in the 20th century,
many discriminatory laws that specifically targeted us were passed.
They mandated the term <em>Cina</em>, a term considered a slur, to be used in
all official communications. They closed all Chinese schools, banned teachings of 
Chinese languages and banned all public displays of Chinese culture. 
They placed systemic barriers for Chinese-Indonesians to enroll into public universities,
to apply to be a public servant, and accessing other public utilities.
They made Chinese-Indonesians take up non-Chinese names.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the fall of the New Order was caused by many things that culminated
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia">May 1998 tragedy</a>.
Massive riots and targeted violence to Chinese-Indonesians occurred: 
burnings of Chinese-Indonesian homes, rape of Chinese-Indonesian women, and murder.
My mom was seven months pregnant with me when this occurred, she was at work,
and had to go into hiding assisted by her coworkers. My dad was at home, 
he kept all lights off and slept on the roof. Our <em>pribumi</em> 
(indigenous Indonesians) neighbors patrolled and claimed that no Chinese-Indonesians 
lived here. </p>
<p>I was born in July 1998, two months later.</p>
<p>The discriminatory laws were not repealed until 2000.
No justice has come out of the cruel rape, murder, and property damage
that occurred in '98, by the way.</p>
<p>So yeah, names.</p>
