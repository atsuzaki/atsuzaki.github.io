## Hi! I'm Katherine Philip

#### I am a PhD student at Portland State University with a focus on programming language design for low-level and systems programming. 

These days I'm working on the backend compiler for [Habit](https://www.habit-lang.org/), a pure functional language for low-level programming. I also think a lot about designing IDE tooling-friendly compilers.

Previously you may have known me as:
- Rust lead at [Kodefox](https://kodefox.com/). I initiated the company-wide Rust adoption, doing a handful of R&D, writing/recording learning materials and teaching people. When not preaching Rust, I do regular Kodefox things: building web and mobile apps as a fullstack dev.
- Concept artist & art generalist at Octosoft, developing [Renaine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/), a charming

On the side,
- I irregularly draw and post the results on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atsuzakii). 
- When time (and motivation) allows, I love doing short gamejams. You can find some of them here: [https://atsuzaki.itch.io/](https://atsuzaki.itch.io/)
