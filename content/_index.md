## Hi! I'm Katherine Philip

### I mostly code for a living and do all sorts of stuff on my free time.
---
As far as day jobs go:
- **I lead the Rust team at [Kodefox](https://kodefox.com/)**. I initiated the company-wide Rust adoption, doing a handful of R&D, writing/recording learning materials and teaching people.
- When not preaching Rust, I do regular Kodefox things: building web and mobile apps as a fullstack dev.

On the side,
- I irregularly draw and post the results on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atsuzakii). 
- When time (and motivation) allows, I love doing short gamejams. You can find some of them here: [https://atsuzaki.itch.io/](https://atsuzaki.itch.io/)
