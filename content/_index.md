## Hi! I'm Katherine Philip.

#### I am a PhD student at Portland State University with a focus on programming language design and implementation for low-level systems programming. 

I work on the [Habit](https://www.habit-lang.org/) project, a pure functional language for low-level programming. These days I'm primarily working on formalizing representation transformation, pipelines in the compiler that changes the representation of data. I also hack on Habit's backend compiler [mil-tools](https://github.com/habit-lang/mil-tools) and collaborate with others hacking on other parts of Habit (frontend compiler, verification, etc).

I'm interested in compiler backends, compiler optimizations, language design, and IDE-friendly compilers and tools. I also like Rust and occasionally hack on rustc.

Previously you may have known me as:
- HPC Compiler Engineer Intern at NVIDIA, working with the amazing folks at NVHPC Compilers (formerly PGI Compilers). I led the [opaque pointers migration](https://llvm.org/docs/OpaquePointers.html) project for their LLVM-based compiler.
- Rust lead at [Kodefox](https://kodefox.com/). I initiated the company-wide Rust adoption, doing a handful of R&D, writing/recording learning materials and teaching people. When not preaching Rust, I do regular Kodefox things: building web and mobile apps as a fullstack dev.
- Concept artist & art generalist at Octosoft, developing [Renaine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/), a charming, quirky action-packed platformer. I do all the non-pixel art and a bunch of random pixel art here and there,

On the side,
- When time (and motivation) allows, I love doing short gamejams. You can find some of them here: [https://atsuzaki.itch.io/](https://atsuzaki.itch.io/)
